## ❌ Critical Gaps (Must Fix!)

### 🏥 **1. Healthcare Apps Experience**
```
Current:  ░░░░░░░░░░ 0%
Required: ██████████ 100%
```

**Impact:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - If this is a healthcare project!

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ No mention of healthcare/medical apps experience
- ❌ No HIPAA compliance knowledge
- ❌ No experience with patient data handling
- ❌ No medical terminology understanding

**Why It Matters:**
- Healthcare apps have **strict regulations** (HIPAA, GDPR)
- Requires **special UI/UX** for doctors and patients
- **Data privacy** is critical
- App store review is **more stringent**

**Recommendation:**
```diff
+ Add requirement: "2+ years experience building healthcare applications"
+ Add requirement: "Understanding of HIPAA/GDPR compliance"
+ Add requirement: "Experience with electronic health records (EHR) systems"
+ Add screening question: "Describe a healthcare app you built and challenges faced"
